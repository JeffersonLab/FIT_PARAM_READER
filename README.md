# FIT_PARAM_READER

this should just print out three files

	1) contains params names, values, and errors
	2) contains correlations
	3) text file explaining details of paramaterization that may be unclear (i.e. CHEW-MANDELSTAM, adler zeros etc...)

should be easy enough to import these as tables in mathematica

works for kmatrix and kinv paramaterization but the info part will fail if you pick other paramaterizatons, let me know if that's a problem and I'll add whatever ones you like

let me know if this isn't what you were looking for
